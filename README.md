# Brave-Game
Since, AML process is mainly manual in some organizations, the role of the personal executing the task is very important to be assessed. And even if technology and data science methods were introduced to the system, a huge part of the system will be controlled by auditors. Hence the relevance of the term “Efficiency” in our research. It is very empirical to ponder the question of effectiveness and efficiency from an internal human function’s side, seeing it as the heart of corporate governance system.

To gain insights into human (employees) responses to the efficiency of the verifications-like tasks, we will introduce BRAVE to investigate how employees think and feel in relation to this notions. Our aim is to get the closer we can to phenomenon of individual efficiency response perception. It consists of players doing dull tasks, and one manager to asses and verify all the answers of other players.

The experiment will mainly answer the question : Does redundant and dull tasks push people to decrease their investment in work ?
